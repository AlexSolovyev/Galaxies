# Caustic Mass Estimator for Galaxy Clusters

This is Python code with my zero experience in writing publicly distributed code. Pointers welcome!
For the original technique see [Diaferio (1999)](http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9906331)
This code is based off [Gifford et al. (2013)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0017) and [Gifford & Miller (2013)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0018)
